                       importance. The Government of Punjab has initiated significant infrastructure and recreation projects in attempts 
                       to increase the standard of living in Mohali. Roads have been built to create networks between Mohali and Chandigarh

                    <br><br>
                    From hand sanitisers in hotel lobbies to cabin crew in masks, localised lockdowns to contact tracing apps, Covid-19 has transformed the world of travel.
                     Amid closed borders and cancelled flights, travel came to a virtual standstill, with the United Nations' World Tourism Organisation declaring 100% of
                      global destinations had implemented travel restrictions at the peak of the pandemic.

                    Today, as much of Asia begins to emerge from lockdown, an industry that accounts for about 10% of world GDP is looking towards the new normal. And travellers, many of whom
                    have been largely confined to their homes for months, are starting to dream again of beaches, mountains and monuments. Yet reopening travel presents its own challenges.</P>
                    <p class="Q2" ><img src="travel-traveling.gif" height="250px" width="250px" align="left">
                    <font align="right">This fear is shaping how travellers approach journeys.First, people are very cautious about the health guidelines, so we work closely with our partners
                     to ensure hotels and airlines are safe partners.Second, people prefer to travel within smaller groups, for example, with family or good friends. Third, we've seen certain
                      demand that used to be for outbound travel now turning to domestic travel.Amid rising domestic and short-haul demand, packages with rental cars and hotels are more popular
                       than less intimate forms of transportation, such as group tours. “It makes people feel safer because you're travelling just with your family".<br>
                       The World Travel and Tourism Council has developed an extensive range of protocols to cover the new normal, for providers as diverse as airlines, shops, hotels and restaurants.
                        Cleaning, sanitisation, protective equipment such as masks, screening tools such as thermal and infrared scanners, and reduced touchpoints and queuing will all shape the
                         travel experience for some time.<br>Travellers' love of foreign climes will endure, albeit with new destinations and nature tourism replacing more crowded places and activities.
                          “Coronavirus is something that has never hit the Earth before.”No nation, no business has had a chance to rehearse for this kind of natural disaster. Based on my experience
                           in Asia, people's demand and desire for travel is very strong. They have been locked down for a long, long time. It's human nature that they want to explore and enjoy their

                <P class="Q2">As we all know, India is one of the world's most famous countries for its unique tourist and tourist destinations. Tourism in all countries plays a big role in the economic 
                    growth and development of a country. If we see tourism in India, it is India's second largest source of income through the foreign currencies of foreign tourists. A large percentage
                     of people's lives East based solely on tourism itself because the tourism industry in India has employed a large number of people in the category, skilled and unskilled. Tourism in
                      any country promotes its national integration and international fraternity. <br>
                      Our country is naturally and culturally endowed with many beautiful and attractive places that have fascinated people around the world. Our country is one of the rich countries
                       with legacies, historical monuments, forts, beaches, religious places, mountain resorts, etc. attracting tourists from around the world. India is known for its unity in diversity
                        that enriches it with people from many cultures, traditions and religions which is the big reason for good tourism here. Because of being rich with people from many religions and
                         languages, our country is full of diversity in handicrafts, folk dances, fairs, festivals, music, ballet, clothing, eating habits, lifestyle, languages, etc. which gives rise to
                          the will or the desire in the hearts of the people of the world to see India.<br></p>
                          <center><img src="amit-jain-pQ04riRO9wM-unsplash.jpg" height="400px"></center>
                    <p class="Q2">Nowadays, tourism in India is strongly promoted by tourism ministries thanks to the help of many Bollywood actors at international and national level. All measures to promote tourism 
                    and the circulation of tourists in the country are recommended by the Tourism Advisory Council. Indian tourism is strongly affected by terrorism, insecurity and pollution in the country;
                    however, the sincere efforts of the Government of India are continuing to develop the Indian tourism industry. It is one of the most dynamic industries and plays a big role in the
                     economic development of the country. Our country is a popular country for tourist destinations throughout Asia where a large crowd of people come every year despite many problems.
                      Our country is naturally limited in its four sides (one by the Himalayas, and three other sides by the Arabian Sea , Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean) offering wide range of sightings.<br> 
                    Variety of interesting activities such as water sports, sailing, scuba diving, rafting, skiing, mountaineering, barges, winter sports, etc. promote tourism in India. In order to encourage people,
                     a tourism campaign named "Incredible India" was launched by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) in 2005. The tourist spots in India have also been divided into sections like spiritual
                      tourism, ecotourism, spa tourism, "and" adventure tourism "to encourage tourism and better growth in India.  <br> 
                    
                    
                    
                    For example, pollution in India has hit the Indian tourism industry; Mathura refinery effluents affect the marbles of Taj Mahal in Agra due to the negligence of the concerned authorities. Another
                     example is that beautiful beaches in India are gradually turning into rubbish dumps and garbage left behind by tourists. Thus, it must overcome the pollution problems in India as well as promote
                      medical tourism to strengthen tourism in India. Medical tourism in the country provides a great level of relief, safety and security to the tourists who will regularly improve the tourism in 
                      the country. Many initiatives have been taken jointly by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Tourism to maintain international standards in medical facilities for tourists.</P>
